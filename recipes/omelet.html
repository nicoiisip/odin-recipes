    <p>A true French omelette, or omelet as we Americans call it, is just eggs and butter, no filling. The egg is folded for a soft, tender texture. It's 10% ingredients and 90% technique, so it does take a bit of practice to perfect.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>Pinch kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs thoroughly until no white steaks are visible. You can choose whether to season it now or later as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Over moderate-high heat, melt a tablespoon of butter. Once it melts, pour in the eggs. Stir quickly! Do your best to mix quickly and constantly to form tiny curds and to prevent any browning</li>
            <li>Once most of the egg is cooked (not completely, there should be some liquid still visible), stop stirring. You donâ€™t want to break the skin that has formed at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Run the fork along the edges of the egg to help it loosen up a bit. Tilt the pan and fold the egg a third of the way, and again until it reaches the other lip.</li>
            <li>Turn over on a plate, with the seam side down. You can adjust the ends by tucking it in a little bit for better presentation.</li>
        </ol>
